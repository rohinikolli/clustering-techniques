# clustering-techniques
The objective is to implement different clustering methods to synthetic and real-world data and validate using external and internal validation techniques
Task 1
Data sets,  “Data1.csv”, “Data2.csv”, “Data3.csv”, “Data4.csv”, “Data5.csv”, “Data6.csv”,
“Data7.csv”, “Data8.csv” contain the data points and their respective class information.
For each of the datasets follow the below steps
1. Use K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to generate clusters
2. Evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithm using external validation
metrics
3. Plot (2D or 3D) the data points for each dataset and color them according to the
original class
4. Plot (2D or 3D) the data points for each dataset and color them according to the
class allocated by the clustering algorithm
ask 2
The world indicators dataset compares different countries based on selected attributes.
1. Use  K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to group similar countries
together
2. Use Internal validation metrics to report the cluster quality
3. Report the best clustering solution. Give a detailed list of all the groups and the
countries included within the groups
4. Generate three different scatter plots of your choice and color the data points
according to the group.Example: “Life expectancyvs GDP”,  “Infant Mortality vs
GDP”, etc.
